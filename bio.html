            <h3>Who am I? </h3>
					<p>My name is Johnny Moctezuma. I am 25 years old living in the Huntington Beach area. I am actively looking for an internship which will utilized the tools I have learned in school and take my knowledge to the next level. I have been exposed to browser based technologies such as HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Handlebars, Firebase, Local Storage, React.js. You can find a link to my GitHub on this webpage which will show you more of the work I have done. I will continue to update my portfolio as I learn new ways of being efficent.</p>
						<p> Thank you for your time. </p>
